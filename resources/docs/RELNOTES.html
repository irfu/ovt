<h1>Release notes and system requirements for OVT version 3.0</h1>

<small>April 21, 2016</small>

<h3>New Features</h3>
<UL>
<LI>Now works on Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux, with identical functionality.
<LI>OVT is installed using an installer software. There is no need to separately install VTK or Java (except for Java which needs to be preinstalled on Linux). Root privileges are not required.
<LI>Ability to use online orbit data from NASA SSC.
<LI>Ability to use online/offline NASA OMNI2 solar wind and magnetospheric data.
</UL>


<h3>Notes</h3>
<UL>
<LI>Miscellaneous data (settings, cache, imported orbit files, IGRF model constants etc.) are installed to, written to (e.g. when importing satellite orbit files), and read from a directory .ovt/&lt;version number&gt;/ and its subdirectories (&quot;mdata&quot;, &quot;conf&quot;, &quot;docs&quot; etc. ), located somewhere under the user directory. Previous versions of OVT may have used the application directory and subdirectories under it for the same purpose. OVT should/might still be able to read files from the corresponding subdirectories under the application directory <i>if</i> the file(s) can not be found under &quot;.ovt&quot; under the user directory.
The user is adviced to be aware of this to avoid confusion on which files are actually being read by the OVT. This can be an issue if installing OVT into the directory of an old OVT installation.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> The initial period in .ovt is omitted on Mac OS X.
